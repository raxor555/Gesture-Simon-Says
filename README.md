# Gesture Simon Says

A gesture-based version of the classic "Simon Says" game, built with OpenCV and MediaPipe. Players repeat sequences of hand gestures—**Open Palm**, **Peace Sign**, and **Middle Three Fingers**—detected via webcam in real-time.

## Features
- **Gesture Detection**: Uses MediaPipe to recognize three distinct hand gestures.
- **Gameplay**: Follow Simon's sequence of gestures to score points; miss one and lose a life (3 lives total).
- **Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV for video processing, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and NumPy for utilities.

## Gestures
- **Open Palm**: All fingers extended.
- **Peace Sign**: Index and middle fingers up.
- **Middle Three Fingers**: Index, middle, and ring fingers up.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `opencv-python`, `mediapipe`, `numpy`
